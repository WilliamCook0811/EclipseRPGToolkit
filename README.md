# Eclipse RPG Toolkit
This is a Python-based text RPG featuring a turn-based combat system, inventory management, and procedural enemy generation. Players can equip weapons and armor, use items, and battle randomized enemies with difficulty scaling.

# Features:
Dynamic Combat: Engage in battles with randomly generated enemies of varying difficulty.

Inventory System: Equip weapons and armor, use healing items, and manage resources.

Procedural Enemy Generation: Enemies are loaded from a file and selected based on difficulty.

Game Loop: Rest, fight, and progress through encounters with shops and traps.

# About
I created this program to teach myself object-oriented programming. Although this is just a framework for future potiental projects, it can still run and be played infinitly.
